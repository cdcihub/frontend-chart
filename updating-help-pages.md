The update of the help pages must be done on the dev server:
http://cdcidev.mtmco.net/cdci/astrooda

Follow the below steps to update the help pages:

* Log-in via the icon !login-icon.jpg! available at the right side of the header of the main panel or by entering the url http://cdcidev.mtmco.net/cdci/astrooda/user
* Click on the item "Content" at the administration menu (horizontal black bar at the top). A table of all content nodes is displayed. The column "Type" show the content type. The content type of the help pages is "Astrooda Help"
* You can filter the content to display the help pages only using the select filter "Type" at the top of the page by selecting "Astrooda Help"
* Click on the link "Edit" in the column "Operations" to update any help page.

In the edit form of a help page the content of the help page is in the field Body. While the field Summary can be used when a list of a help pages is displayed (a view).

To insert an image in the the text, add first the image in the field "Images to Insert", click on "Choose file" under "Add new file", then click on "Upload". Once the file uploaded, put the cursor in the place where you want to insert the image within the Body or Summary fields and click on the button "Insert" appearing near the image.

Note that a table of content (TOC) is created by the system in the top-right corner of the page. The TOC is constructed using the HTML heading H2.
